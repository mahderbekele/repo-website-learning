    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="margin-inline-start: 100px; margin-inline-end: 100px;">Arriving at a campus in a different country was a very new experience, but when I entered the campus I was mesmerised by the green garden and oddly by the structure of the building. 
        The staff and alumni were very welcoming as we arrived.As it was the first week it was intimidating as there were people from different cultures and backgrounds 
        and it was a bit hard to get familiar with a new environment and different family. As the week went on we became familiar with each other and it wasnâ€™t as intimidating as it was the first days.

        <p style="margin-inline-start: 100px; margin-inline-end: 100px;">The first few days were us(the students) trying to get used to the environment,classes were introductions and we got to explore the campus.
             After the 4th day classes were in session and we had assignments to do and the actual feeling of training kicked in and after that it just felt like 
             I have been here in AkiraChix for more than just 5 days.

    <ol style="margin-inline-start: 100px; margin-inline-end: 100px;">
        <li>Getting the chance to get along with new people as I was not a very social person</li>
        <li>Interacting with people from different backgrounds</li>
        <li>Learning new culture</li>
        <li>Learning the good use of time</li>
    </ol>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 500px;">The not so good experiences I had so far were </h3>
   
   <ul style="margin-inline-start: 100px; margin-inline-end: 100px;">
    <li>Feeling homesick</li>
    <li>And on the first days it was difficult to keep up with kenyan culture as my mental state was still on my own country</li>
    <li>It was a bit new to get used to the cultural foods as well.</li>
   </ul>
